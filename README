Prerequisites:

Install Ruby: http://ruby-lang.org

   recommend Ruby 1.8.6. (Even if you are using modal dialogs.)

Watir is packaged as a gem, a Ruby library that can be installed over the
   internet.

 The latest version of Watir is 1.6.5 whose close function doesn't work fine if we handle pop-up's in our  scripts.But close function of Watir 1.6.2 works fine with pop-up handling.Watir 1.6.2 was released in November  2009. 
 
 To install it, type this at command prompt:
      
  gem install watir (for latest version)
  gem install watir

 -v 1.6.2 (for version 1.6.2) 
 
Install rspec:
  
 gem install rspec (This will download the latest version)
  
 gem install rspec -v 1.1.3 (This version is also needed because of some compatibility issue)

Pop Up's Support

  Now,You can easily handle pop-up's. 

  
 
 Note: The latest version of Watir is 1.6.5 whose close function doesn't work fine if we handle pop-up's in our        scripts.But close function of Watir 1.6.2 works fine with pop-up handling.
